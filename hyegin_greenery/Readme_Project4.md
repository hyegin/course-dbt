Part 3: Reflection questions -- please answer 3A 

if your organization is thinking about using dbt, how would you pitch the value of dbt/analytics engineering to a decision maker at your organization?
dbt allows analytics engineer to do what traditionally data engineers had to do. Given that analytics engineer understands data engineering principles, they can manipulate data using SQL.

if your organization is using dbt, what are 1-2 things you might do differently / recommend to your organization based on learning from this course?
My company already uses dbt but what I would suggest is having more targetted data marts that non technical people can utilize. 

what skills have you picked that give you the most confidence in pursuing this next step?
I didn't know what good data modeling looked like. It gave me better understanding of what is considered good.
